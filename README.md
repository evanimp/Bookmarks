# final-project

RUNNING: 
The only install I did for this project was     pip install pycrypto
However, when I do a "pip freeze" I also see cryptography==2.1.4 and asn1crypto==0.24.0 so I added all three to requirements.txt But you might be able to just run pip install pycrypto.

This document describes usage of my password encryption app. Each task is labeled in capital letters and is followed by a list of steps. In addition to this help. There are tool tips used on most controls.

CREATE A FOLDER:
1) Type the name of the folders into the textbox in the lower left hand corner of the main page.
2) Press the "Add" button to the right.

NOTES:
a) You must add at least one folder before adding places(URL's and devices).

CREATE A PLACE: (Places are typically URL's or devices that users have passwords for.)
1) On top of the "Search" box on the right of the main page, click the button labeled "Add URL or Device".
2) A new page opens. Fill in the form in the page.
3) Press the button labeled "Save".

SEARCH FOR AN ITEM:
1) The search box is on the right side of the main page.
2) Type some text to search for. Type part or all of the place's name or location.
3) Press the search button.
4) Places that contain the text in their name or location will be displayed.

SEARCH FOR A PLACE BY FOLDER:
1) Click on the name of a folder on the left side of the main screen.
2) Places in that folder will be displayed on the right.

EDIT AN ITEM:
1) Click on the edit button to the right of a place.
2) Change the places' info and click save.

VIEW AN ITEM:
1) Click on the View button to the right of a place.
2) While viewing the item, you may have info copied to the clipboard. (described below)

COPYING INFO TO CLIPBOARD:
1) First "VIEW AN ITEM" as described above.
2) Click on the Location, Username, or Password textbox. This copies the text from the box clicked.
3) You may now paste the text into another textbox, file, etc.

DELETE A PLACE:
1) Press the delete button to the right of the place.

DELETE A FOLDER:
1) Press the delete button to the right of the folder.
2) Note: This will delete all of the places in the folder. The number of places is indicated to the right of each folder. The only warning is the tooltip help.

NOTES:
a) Hardware is typically referred to by name, such as "My IPad". The location might vary, or be something like "My Room". URL's are put into the location field. So the name might be an abbreviation. For example, "https://boston.craigslist.org/" would be the location and the name might be "Craigs List"

b) The website does not remember what your last search was if you leave the page. If you press the name of a folder, the places in that folder will be displayed. If you then view a particular place and go back to the main page, all places will be displayed unless you search again.
